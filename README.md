## Mods

### Sacrifice Artifact Drop Rate Changer
Lets you change the rate at which items drop from enemies when using the sacrifice artifact.

It only takes into account the percent entered in the config, meaning it will not take XP and monster value into account, unlike the default behavior.

### Uncapped Convergence
Makes Focused Convergence have no limit instead of capping at 3.

Makes the game unplayable at around 18 of the item due to how the item works.

### Artifact of Sequencing
Spawn with a starting item of every tier. Any picked up items will be converted to the starting item of the same tier.

It's basically like a Shrine of Order that is applied at the very start of a run, and auto-converts any items picked up after the start.

It doesn't apply to no-tier items (like tonic affliction), nor does it apply to equipment items.
